## This project cloudscrapes stats from KenPom to make predictions about hypothetical team matchups. 

### Since the official KenPom website is subscription blocked, I had to use a cloudscraper instead of a normal website parser to read in the data. Most websites that are subscription blocked will block requests, and the cloudscraper bypasses such blocks.
